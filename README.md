This project involves using the KNN classification algorithm in order to classify patients into various clinical dementia ratings based on [cross-sectional MRI data]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers)) provided by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). This organization provides multiple neuroimaging datasets to the public to allow researchers and scientists to learn and make discoveries in neuroscience.
